# Strength Coach

**Strength Coach** is an android app that allows an user to find a fitness trainer. The app utilizes geolocation to match users with trainers.

## Problem Statements

**Problem Statement:** Fitness trainers are really expensive <br/>

## Proposed Solution

The trainers who work at well known Gyms are really expensive. The reason is that Gym decides how much they would charge for trainer's time and take a huge cut from the same.

If you look around in your Gym, there are lot of people who unserstand fitmess and can help you reach your goal. There is just no way of knowing if they are interested and what would they charge.

Our app is the marketplace which brings the trainers and users together. Trainers can sign up and choose the price and time that suits them. User can browse through trainers, look at their pictures, read reviews and book training sessions.
