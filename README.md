# Uber Workout

**Uber Workout** is an android app that allows an user to find a workout buddy or a instructor who can train the user. The app utilizes geolocation and preferences to easily match users

## Problem Statements

**Problem 1:** Working out alone is boring <br/>

## Proposed Solution

We plan to build an android app that provides a platform for finding a workout partner based on the user's location or user's choice of gym. Our app provides an option of filtering the users based on the preferences like workout time, schedule or routine. Our app provides additional features such as inbuilt chat system, camera and maps for picking up the location.

Our application will have a feature of registering as a **Instructor** if the user would like to train other co-users with a much lower hourly rate. The app has a rating system to rate the service of the instructor which allows the users to avail the services of the instructor. The payment to the service of the Premium Users is processed through the app.
